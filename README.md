# Project 3 - BeReal

Submitted by: Daisi Perez

BeReal is a social media app that allows you to upload pictures in real time. There is a feed that demonstrates pictures shared by the users in addition to a caption and location. 
There is now a comment feature and users can't see other posts unless they post first! After 24 hours, all posts get get erased from the feed, thus, making
room for more posts!

Time spent: 10 hours spent in total

## Notes

My biggest challenge while working on this app was the comment secton. I had a lot of trouble with the UI features on storyboard, especially the keyboard functionality.
I tried implementing it using the the bottom constraint plugin but it would not work for dear life! I ended up just coding it in the CommentViewFinder.swift file.
I would like to mention that posts actually do get erased after 24 hours! The previous posts made from part 1 of this project are long gone, as demonstrated in the video.
